03 - NodeJS Fundamentals: Internals 

3.1 - Nodejs runtime and its internals 

    - Nodejs can run plain-convential js using V8, but it's not only limited to that. 
    - It can also do much more that are out of scope for plain-conventional js. Things like making an http request and getting a response, reading from and writing to a file or database, etc. All these tasks require an extra layer of processing that isn't part of js, but somthing more.
    - Hence, nodejs APIs come into play. APIs like http, fs, path and the like. 
    - A few of them have been written in js but most of them are written in lower-level languages such as C/C++ and can be used to do the above mentioned processes. These apis are known as "Node.js Bindings"
    - The actual implementation of such APIs lives inside "libuv", which is a library that lets nodejs perform async executions and make it very powerful.
